[![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo)

## ✨ Try this test Sports Python OER playground in your browser (JupyterLite deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages) ✨

➡️ **https://sportspython.github.io/jupyterlite_test0**

## Requirements

JupyterLite is being tested against modern web browsers:

- Firefox 90+
- Chromium 89+

Recommend using Firefox.

Use the standard Window (i.e. not the Private Window, which currently has known performance issues (https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite/issues/679)).

## Notes
Need to run `%matplotlib inline` to display matplotlib graphs in the jupyter notebook.
